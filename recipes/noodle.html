                uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked

            <li>Melt butter in the pot, and stir together the drained 
                noodles, cottage cheese, salt, and applesauce. Mix in the 
                sugar and cinnamon. Add the beaten eggs; stir to 
                blend all ingredients. Pour mixture into prepared baking dish.</li>
            <li>Bake until top is very brown, about 1 hour.</li>
